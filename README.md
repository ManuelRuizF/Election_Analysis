# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Election employee gave me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.  

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidares who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. The voter turnout for each county.
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
8. The county with the highest turnout.
  
We wanted to get these results in order to calcultate the *potential* winner of the election and see how strong his/her political party is.  
We are going to measure the power of each candidate distributed along the counties involved in the election.
